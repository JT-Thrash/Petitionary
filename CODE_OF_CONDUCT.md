# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of Petitionary, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and platform
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Political bias or politically charged comments
* Inflammatory or hate speech, discriminatory jokes and language
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Spam or redundant contributions without first checking existing issues
* Discussing policies, political issues, or controversial topics in code reviews
* Using the contribution process to debate platform content rather than code quality
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope of Technical Contributions

Contributions to Petitionary should focus exclusively on:

* Code quality, performance, and functionality
* Bug fixes and technical improvements
* Documentation clarity and accuracy
* Accessibility and user experience enhancements
* Security improvements

Contributions are **not** the appropriate venue for:

* Debates about which issues should be prioritized on the platform
* Policy discussions that would be appropriate within the app itself
* Arguments about the merits of specific petitions or causes
* Political discussions of any kind

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:
* Comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct
* Contributors who fail to follow the Code of Conduct

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

## Additional Guidelines

* **Due Diligence**: Before submitting issues or pull requests, search existing and closed issues to avoid duplication.
* **Inclusive Environment**: Make space for everyone to contribute, especially newcomers.
* **Focus on Constructive Feedback**: When reviewing code, focus on technical aspects rather than stylistic preferences.
* **Respect Time Boundaries**: Understand that maintainers and contributors may have limited availability.
* **Documentation**: Help improve documentation to make the project more accessible to others.
* **Clear Communication**: Be specific in issue reports and pull requests to ensure efficiency.

## Contact

If you have questions about this Code of Conduct or need to report violations, please contact the project maintainers through the designated channels.

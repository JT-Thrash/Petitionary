# Petitionary

<!-- # TODO : Add a project logo -->

## Overview

Petitionary is a civic engagement platform that empowers citizens to generate and submit AI-powered petitions to government representatives on important issues like environmental protection, food safety, and public health. The platform aims to shift power to the public by increasing transparency and creating accountability for unresponsive officials.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Petition Generator**: Create professional, effective petitions from simple issue descriptions
- **Representative Matching**: Automatically find your relevant government representatives based on ZIP code
- **Public Petition Board**: Discover trending petitions and track government responsiveness
- **Multiple Submission Options**: Email representatives directly, download as PDF, or share publicly
- **Response Tracking**: Log and track official responses to increase accountability
- **Wall of Silence**: Highlight representatives who consistently ignore constituent concerns

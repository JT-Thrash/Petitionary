## Reporting a Vulnerability

Petitionary takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them directly to the project maintainers by:

1. Emailing [jordanthrash52@gmail.com](mailto:jordanthrash52@gmail.com)
2. Creating a private vulnerability report through GitHub's Security Advisory feature

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential solutions you've identified
- Whether you would like to be credited for the finding

### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report:

- You'll receive acknowledgment within 48 hours
- We'll investigate and provide an estimated timeline for a fix
- We'll keep you informed about the progress of the fix
- We'll notify you when the issue is resolved

## Security Considerations for Contributors

When contributing to Petitionary, please consider these security practices:

### Data Protection

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, credentials, personal data)
- Use environment variables for configuration secrets
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow the principle of least privilege when handling user data

### AI-Related Security

- Implement appropriate rate limiting on AI generation endpoints
- Add content filtering mechanisms for petition text generation
- Review AI-generated content for potential security or legal issues
- Implement monitoring for misuse of AI capabilities

### Web Security

- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection attacks)
- Keep dependencies updated and regularly audit for vulnerabilities

### Infrastructure

- Use proper error handling that doesn't leak system information
- Implement appropriate logging (without sensitive data)
- Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Regularly back up petition data

## Security Updates and Disclosure Policy

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. We will disclose security issues after:

1. A patch has been developed and tested
2. The update has been released to users
3. We've given users reasonable time to apply the update

We will credit security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities if they wish to be acknowledged.
